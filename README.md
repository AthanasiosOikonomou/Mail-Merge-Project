# Mail-Merge-Project

I did this as a side project to learn how to use real case scenarios with python.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Consouldenature/Mail-Merge-Project`
2. In the path 'Mail Merge Project\Input\Names\invited_names.txt' add the names you want to send an email.
3. In the path 'Mail Merge Project\Input\Letters\starting_letter.txt change the email as you like.
4. If you kept the same placeholder as me ([name]) you do not need to change anything, else open the main.py and change the placeholder:
